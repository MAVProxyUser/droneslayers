			10. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.1 Generally.</span> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DJI in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DJI agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.2 Exceptions.</span> Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.3 Arbitrator.</span> Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, <b>“AAA Rules”</b>) of the American Arbitration Association (<b>“AAA”</b>), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.4 Notice; Process.</span> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (<b>“Notice”</b>). DJI’s address for Notice is: 14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (<b>“Demand”</b>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DJI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, DJI will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DJI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.5 Fees.</span> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DJI will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DJI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.6 No Class Actions.</span> YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.7 Modifications of This Arbitration Provision.</span> If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DJI's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="sub-title">10.8 Enforceability.</span> If Section 10.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 (other than, in the latter case, Section 10.6) will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 8 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
